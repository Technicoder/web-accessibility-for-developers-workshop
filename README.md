# Web Accessibility for Developers Workshop

> Essential Tools for Inclusive Coding

Hello everyone, I'm Scott Vinkle, a front end developer and accessibility advocate at [Shopify](https://shopify.com/).

During this 1-day workshop we'll be covering quite a few different topics. All of which will be focused on usability, accessibility, and inclusive thinking in design and development.

Essentially what we'll be discussing is common accessibility issues found in design and development, how they affect different user groups, and ways to overcome the barriers introduced for people with disabilities.

We'll also be fixing up a small blog website that is ripe full of accessibility issues! Throughout the day we'll be looking at various issues and ways to make sure the site is accessible and inclusive for everyone!
